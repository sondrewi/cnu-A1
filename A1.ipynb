    "The 'down' direction provides the more accurate result (graphs and table in 2.2). Floating point values stored by python are accurate only to 15 or 16 significant figures (due to storing in binary). After each addition, Python rounds the resulting sum to a number it can represent correct to 15 or 16 significant figures (Goldberg, 1991). Notice that with 'down' method, Python adds numbers to the_sum in ascending order. Thus, the very small numbers do not get 'rounded away' as they do in the 'up' method, where numbers are added in descending order. With 'down' method, the sum of the very small numbers grows to such a size that when it gets added to the bigger ones, it is not rounded away.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate this with an example that is shown above. Making numpy use 40 d.p we see that when doing a sum such as $10^{-18}+3*10^{-18}$, python stores the result as $0.0000000000000000040000000000000002861697$, which is accurate to 16 significant figures. \n",
    "However, when python does the sum $0.1+3*10^{-18}$ it stores the result as $0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021182$, which is precisely the same as how python stores 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, for small enough N, the 'up' method (with which we start by adding 'large' numbers to the_sum) will be relatively accurate since the small numbers do not get so small as to get 'rounded away' once they get added to the_sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as can be seen from graph 2, small rounding errors can also ocurr for 'down' method since the sum to which numbers are added is growing.\n",
